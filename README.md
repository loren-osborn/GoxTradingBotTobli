GoxTradingBot (Tobli version)
=============================

Gox Trading Bot Chrome Extension

This project is modified/enhanced version of the original Gox Trading Bot (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gox-trading-bot/iejmifigokhpcgpmoacllcdiceicmejb)


Disclaimer
----------
The authors of this project is NOT responsible for any damage or loss caused by this software.
There can be bugs, and the bot may not perform as expected or specified.
The author has tested it and is using it himself, but there are NO warranties whatsoever!
Please consider testing it first with a small amount of funds, and check to the code to see what how it's working.



Enhanced features of this modified bot
--------------------------------------

 * Change sample intervals for the EMA calculations (1 min, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours)
 
 * Decide when to trade after trend switch (1-5 samples above/below thresholds, separate settings for buy/sell)
 
 * Separate buy and sell thresholds
 
 * Trade in fiat currencies other than USD
 
 * Keep an amount of BTC away from trading
 
 * Detect and eliminate peaks/invalid samples from MtGox

 * Possibility to disable actual trading (the bot does everything, except the actual trading). Good for testing if e.g. a changed sample interval will cause a trend switch and would trigger an immediate trade.
 
 * Zoomable chart with price, EMA-values and trigger indicators

 * Caching trade data to avoid hammering of MtGox and faster loading
 
 * Option to always start the bot in "disabled" mode to avoid instant accidental trading with "bad" settings from last run.
 
 * Using MtGox API v2 for more reliable access
 
 * Improved stability on networks problems and MtGox access failures

- Fixed error fetchig user info from MtGox when a currency with no funds (in MtGox) was selected in the settings

0.2.2.1

- Fixed wrong popup-windows height when the chart tooltip showed

- Experimental section added
- Experimental feature: Only trade after trend switch (if starting the bot between trend switches, wait until next swicth)

- Lowered retry-rate when failed to fetch user info (retry after 1 minute instead of 10 seconds) to avoid hammering MtGox
- More robust handling of network problems (updates could stop after a network loss) - bot should now update and resume within a minute
- Better handling when computer resumes from sleep (updates could stop after sleep) - bot should now update and resume within a minute

0.2.1.8
- Fixed stupid bug, not fetching last sample properly ("Update not finished - do not trade!" in the console log)

0.2.1.7
- Fixed problem with garbage in cache after switching currency (the cache will now be flushed when changing currency)
- Fixed problem fetching trade data with very short intervals and currecies with very low trading volumes (it's still a problem to get accurate EMA-values, but it's not quite possible when hardly any trades are being made!)
- Selecting currency in settings is now made from a drop-down list
- New icon: green eyes = trading is enabled :)

0.2.1.6
- Switched to MtGox API v2 by default (seems more stable when MtGox is DDoS:ed or having oher problems)

- Improved speed/effectiveness when fetching data from MtGox (use or cache all usable data in every chunk)

- Cache trade data in local storage (a lot faster loading and less hammering of MtGox servers on restart)

- Lowered minimum sample interval to 1 minute for those who would like to experiment
- Separate "Buy/Sell after X samples above/below thresholds"
- Allow buy/sell after up to 5 samples (could be useful with very short sample intervals)

0.2.1.4
- Fixed fetching trades with no API key. The bot can now be used to monitor trend without an API Key (but it will not be able to trade of course)
- Experimental implementation of MtGox API v2 (set "useAPIv2=true" in file "background.js" if you want to test. But be warned: It's not extensively tested, so use at your own risk!)
